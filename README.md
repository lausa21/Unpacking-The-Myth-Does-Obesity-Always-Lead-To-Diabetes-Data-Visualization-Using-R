# üìä Unpacking The Myth: Does Obesity Always Lead To Diabetes? 

## üìù Project Description
This project utilizes the **R programming language** to analyze and visualize the complex relationship between obesity and the prevalence of diabetes. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, this analysis seeks to answer the critical question: "Does obesity always lead to diabetes?"

The project unpacks this common myth by exploring multiple contributing factors. The analysis concludes that while obesity is a significant risk factor, **it is not a definitive cause**. Diabetes is a multifactorial condition heavily influenced by a combination of genetics, age, lifestyle choices, and other physiological factors. The final output is an infographic and an interactive Shiny application that clearly communicate these findings.

## ‚ú® Key Findings & Visualizations
The analysis, summarized in the infographic, reveals several key insights:
1.  **Obesity Is Not a Direct Cause**
    * A striking finding is that **54.3% of obese women** in the dataset do not suffer from diabetes, directly challenging the misconception that the two are inseparable.
2.  **Age as a Major Factor**
    * The risk of developing diabetes significantly increases with age. Visualizations show that older age groups have a much higher percentage of diabetic individuals compared to younger groups.
3.  **Strong Genetic Predisposition**
    * The data indicates a strong genetic link. Individuals with a higher "genetic factor index"‚Äîimplying a family history of diabetes‚Äîare substantially more prone to a diagnosis, a factor that is even more pronounced in obese individuals.
4.  **Correlation with Number of Pregnancies**
    * A clear correlation exists between the number of pregnancies and a diabetes diagnosis. The analysis shows an average of **5 pregnancies** for diabetic women, compared to an average of **3** for non-diabetic women.
5.  **Global Health Context**
    * To underscore the project's relevance, the infographic highlights that diabetes was the **8th leading cause of death worldwide** in 2018, emphasizing the need for better public understanding of its risk factors.
